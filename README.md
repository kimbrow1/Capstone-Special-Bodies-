# Special Bodies

Hello! Welcome to Special Bodies. This is a community that best fits parents who have kids or relatives with special needs. It is extremely important that we all make sure that people with special needs be treated fairly and have the same opportunities as everyone else. Over time I have realized that it is extremely difficult for people with special needs to feel like they are normal. The reason for that is because there are very few events that they are able to attend. This website is a platform to make sure that parents have the resources to find the locations and areas in which they can attend. In addition to that make sure to provide things at home that they can do in order to make sure they stay active and eat correctly.

Specaial Bodies website was created using a single page application format. A single-page application is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of the browser loading entire new pages. When creating theis website I used the HTML and CSS for the front end and Node.js and Express for the back end. This website also includes videos which were implemented by HTML and CSS as well.This website is currently running on the local server and can also be viewed on Netlify.

 I used the Open Weather Map in order to pull the weather from their database.
